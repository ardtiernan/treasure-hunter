Just a weird game I thought of. I knew I needed to take some sort of input so that I could execute logic in the backend. But I didn't want to do a quiz, and I thought it would be fun to work with postgres.

Obviously it doesn't know if you're actually telling the truth.
Instead, it knows how consistent you are in your answers, requiring  80-90% consistency. Given the game motivates users to answer 'truthfully' significantly more often than lie, it can assume that the majority answer for a particular question is the truth.

I bit off a bit more than I could chew with a 2 hour time-limit. This took me 5 hours.

Thanks for the challenge - it was fun!
